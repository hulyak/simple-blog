#### Prerequisites

- Comfortable with Html
- Javascript, ES6 to see what is React and what is Javascript
- Basic React knowledge like props, components, one way-data-flow

### What we will cover

- Using state and useState
- fetching an API with useEffect
- use of custom hooks in our application

**By the end of the tutorial, you will have the following skill sets:**

The hands-on practical and real-life scenario of creating Weather Application using React Hooks

## What Are React Hooks?

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. With the help of hooks, we can use state and other React features without writing a class.

Before Hooks, we would need to understand how **this** keyword works in Javascript, and to remember to bind event handlers in class components.
There wasn't a particular way to reuse stateful component logic and this made the code harder to follow.

We needed to share stateful logic in a better way. React is designed to render components, and it doesn't know anything about routing, fetching data, or architecture of our project. So, React Hooks came to the rescue.

Hooks are just functions that are exported from the official React page. They allow us to manipulate components in a different manner.

Hooks allow for attaching reusable logic to an existing component and use state and lifecycle methods inside a React functional component.
We can organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units. Hooks give developers the opportunity to separate **presentation logic**, the logic that is associated with how components appear on a page, from **business logic**, the logic that is associated with handling, manipulating, and storing business objects.

There are some **rules** about how to use hooks. The following rules are:

- only call hooks at the top level of the component
- don't call hooks inside loops, conditionals, or nested functions
- only call hooks from React functions
- call them from within React functional components and not just any regular Javascript function

Okay, now let's start working with our application.

### Application Tools

- [x] Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure it is the LTS(long term support) version. LTS version is a less stable version of NodeJS. We will use NPM (node package manager) and we will use it to install **create-react-app**.
![node.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201672195/feZT-jPGe.png)
- [x] Install your preferred code editor or IDE. I will be using Visual Studio Code. You can download it from [this website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is free to use.
![vscode.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201726285/MP-0R7L5z.png)
- [x] **create-react-app** is an npm package that we can bootstrap our React application without any configuration.
![cra.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201740616/y7tmrCOfq.png)

Let's install our project. Open up your terminal and `cd` into the directory you want to create the project.

```bash
cd desktop
# type this command to install create-react-app, you can give any name for the app.
npx create-react-app weather-app
```

Now, let's wait for the project to be created, now all the packages are installed for us to use it.

![terminal](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201602250/Z6Ok5jG5Y.png)

Let's go inside our project folder, type the name of our project, and `cd` into it.

```bash
cd weather-app
# open the project files with Visual Studio or any code editor

#start the app
npm start
```

![app.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201775384/JNZxBhdGd.png)

Now we can see our app is up and running. Before starting our app, let's make some cleanup and remove some of the files that we will not use.

Let's remove `App.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, setupTests.js` from the `src` folder. You can copy and paste the basic structure for App.js and index.js from the code snippets below.

```javascript
// App.js

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return <div className="App"></div>;
}

export default App;
```

```javascript
// index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

Also, we can remove `logo` files from the `public` folder, now my files are looking like this:

## Explore Open Weather App and Styling

###  Getting Our API Key

Let's go to [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get our API key to fetch real weather data.

Choose [5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) from the page. With this API, we can get access to the next 5-day weather data for a specified city.
But before we use the open weather map, we need to have an **API key**. For that [create an account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and go to the API keys tab to see your API key.

![openWeather.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201912065/Icm3KI3st.png)

![key.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201925848/BL7Nh92t4.png)

Let's check the example from the page and open a new tab and paste this URL.

```bash
# replace API key with your API key
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=London,us&appid={API key}
```

Now, we can see the JSON data.

![api.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201945446/5JGdAvYC_.png)

Default data comes with the _imperial_ system, we can change it to the _metric_ system by specifying another query parameter. If you are comfortable using the imperial system, you don't need to change the query.

```bash
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=London,us&appid={API key}&units=metric
```

![api_call.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605201957775/s6u4jPMBp.png)

Now, let's see what we get from our data. We will be using the icon for the weather, let's see what the code means. From the documentation, we can find [this page](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions) and see what the icon codes mean. We will use this URL `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/10d@2x.png` for our image source.

We will fetch the minimum and maximum temperature of the next five days, along with icons.

Now, let's create a new folder named `apis` directory under the `src` directory and create a new file named `config.js` for our API key, and add this file to your `.gitignore` file to not to expose our API key. Also, let's put our `baseUrl` here. We will come back here later to add our fetching logic.

```javascript
// apis/config.js
export const API_KEY = [YOUR_API_KEY];
export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/';
```

### Styling The App

_We will be using React Bootstrap for styling the app. You can check out [the documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)._

Let's install the react-bootstrap to our project

```javascript
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

Now, we need to include CSS to our project inside `src > index.js`.

```javascript
// index.js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
## Creating our First Component ðŸ¥³

Let's start by creating our first component and show our API data to the user.

Inside the `src` folder, let's create another folder named `components`. Now, create our first component and name it `WeatherCard.js`
This component will be a functional component and it will receive some props and we will display them. We will use the `Bootstrap Card component` to add some styling.
Now, we can copy [Card component](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/) from bootstrap to our component. We don't need `Card.Text` and `Button`, we will remove those.

```javascript
// components/WeatherCard.js

import React from 'react';
import {Card} from 'react-bootstrap';

const WeatherCard = (props) => {
  return (
    <Card style={{width: '18rem'}}>
      <Card.Img variant="top" src="holder.js/100px180" />
      <Card.Body>
        <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default WeatherCard;
```

We want to show the `minimum` and `maximum temperatures` for a date, but `dt` datetime is in Unix timestamp. Also, we will display the `main` weather.
Now, let's extract our props and display them inside the jsx. Props have the same name as the JSON data that we get from API.

For the icon, we can get a list of [weather conditions](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions). Every icon has a different code number.

- example URL :`http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/10d@2x.png`

We will replace `10d` with the `icon` prop to make it dynamic.

```javascript
// components/WeatherCard.js

import React from 'react';
import {Card} from 'react-bootstrap';

const WeatherCard = ({dt, temp_min, temp_max, main, icon}) => {
  // create a date object with Date class constructor
  const date = new Date(dt);
  return (
    <Card style={{width: '18rem'}}>
      <Card.Img
        variant="top"
        // get the src from example url and pass the icon prop for icon code
        src={`http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${icon}@2x.png`}
      />
      <Card.Body>
        <Card.Title>{main}</Card.Title>
        {/*  datetime is received in milliseconds, let's turn into local date time */}
        <p>
          {date.toLocaleDateString()} - {date.toLocaleTimeString()}
        </p>
        {/* minimum temperature */}
        <p>Min: {temp_min}</p>
        {/* maximum temperature */}
        <p>Max: {temp_max}</p>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default WeatherCard;
```

Now, let's import the `WeatherCard` component into `App.js`. And pass our props, we will pass hardcoded values for now.

```javascript
// App.js

import React from 'react';
import WeatherCard from './components/WeatherCard';
import './App.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* dt is in unix-seconds but javascript uses milliseconds, multiply with 1000 */}
      <WeatherCard
        dt={1602104400 * 1000}
        temp_min="22.67"
        temp_max="24.39"
        main="Clear"
        icon="01d"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now, let's start our app with `npm start` from the terminal. We can see our weather data is displayed. We will use this component to show the next 5 days.

![weather-1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605202069514/iuV-NVEkD.png)

## City Selector Component

We will make a new component that the user can select a city and we will display the weather data for that city.

In our component, we will create `input` and a `button`. When the user clicks the button, we will fetch the weather forecast for that city.

We will use Bootstrap Layout to create rows and columns. You can find the documentation at [this link.](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/layout/grid/)

Now, let's go to the components folder and create another folder named `CitySelector.js` and create our boilerplate code.

## useState Hook

State helps build highly performant web apps. To keep track of our application logic, we need to use state. We can reflect any UI or the user interface changes via changes in state.

To be able to change our button's state, we need a special hook named `useState`. With `useState`, we can add state to functional components.

`useState` returns an array of two items the first element is the _current value of the state_, and the second is a _state setter function_. State tracks the value of our state. Whenever the state updates, it should also rerender JSX elements. The setter function is gonna be used to update our state value.

In class components, state is always an object, with the useState hook, the state does not have to be an object.

When dealing with objects or arrays, always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.

Every time, with every rerender we don't mutate our state, we get a completely new state, we can change our state, with the setter function.

We need to contain one state property and that will be the _city_. In order to use, _useState_ in our component, we have to import _useState_ first. _useState_ is a named export; so, we will export it with curly braces.

`import React, { useState } from 'react';`

Our goal is to update the state when a user clicks on a button.

We need to define a new variable and set it to `useState` hook. Inside the hook as an argument, we need to pass the `initial` value as an _empty string_.

```javascript
// components/CitySelector

import React, {useState} from 'react';

const CitySelector = () => {
  const [city, setCity] = useState('');
  return <div></div>;
};

export default CitySelector;
```

We will add _Row, Col, FormControl, and Button_ components from Bootstrap to create our JSX elements. FormControl is for our `input` element and we need to take its value by passing `event.target.value`
We will pass for the `Button` component one function for now, we will use it soon to display our data.

```javascript
// components/CitySelector.js

import React, {useState} from 'react';
import {Row, Col, FormControl, Button} from 'react-bootstrap';

const CitySelector = () => {
  const [city, setCity] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <Row>
        <Col>
          <h1>Search your city</h1>
        </Col>
      </Row>

      <Row>
        {/* xs={4} takes the one third  of the page*/}
        <Col xs={4} className="text-center">
          <FormControl
            placeholder="Enter city"
            // update city value with the user's input
            onChange={(event) => setCity(event.target.value)}
            // value will be the currently selected city
            value={city}
          />
        </Col>
      </Row>

      <Row>
        <Col>
          {/* event handler for button click */}
          <Button onClick={onSearch} }>Check Weather</Button>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </>
  );
};

export default CitySelector;
```

Now, let's import our CitySelector component into App.js. Also, we can remove our hardcoded WeatherCard component, we can now get the city data from user input.

Our App component is now looking like this. Also, I added a _Container_ from bootstrap.

```javascript
// App.js

import React from 'react';
import CitySelector from './components/CitySelector';
import './App.css';
import {Container} from 'react-bootstrap';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Container className="App">
      <CitySelector />
    </Container>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Also, copy and paste this CSS code into your `App.css` file.

```css
/* App.css */

.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.row {
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 15px 0;
}
```

## Displaying API Results

Now, time to display our API data inside our application.

Let's go back to our `CitySelector` component and call our API.

First, let's create an anonymous function for our `onSearch` function.

To grab data from an external resource or to just retrieve data, we will use `fetch` browser API. Fetch takes our `url` call. We need to get our `baseUrl` and our `Api key` from our `config.js` file. Let's import it to our file.

`import {API_KEY, API_BASE_URL} from '../apis/config';`

Fetch returns a promise and we need to await it, we will put `.then`, after that our response will be in `json` format, we need to extract the body of the response, and finally, we will get our `result`.

Now `onSearch` function should look like this:

```javascript
// components/CitySelector.js

const onSearch = () => {
  fetch(`${ API_BASE_URL}/data/2.5/forecast?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((result) => console.log(result));
};
```

![api.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605203143423/a_wzV23eu7.gif)


Also, we can show our data when the user presses the `Enter` key. Let's implement that with JavaScript.
Add `onKeyDown` to `FormControl (input)`, it will receive a callback function with the event inside.

```javascript
// components/CitySelector.js

const onKeyDown = (event) => {
  if (event.keyCode === 13) {
    onSearch();
  }
};

<Row>
  <Col xs={4} className="text-center">
    <FormControl
      placeholder="Enter city"
      onChange={(event) => setCity(event.target.value)}
      value={city}
      // add onKeyDown
      onKeyDown={onKeyDown}
    />
  </Col>
</Row>;
```

To display our data, we need to create another state for our `results`.

```javascript

// components/CitySelector.js

const CitySelector = () => {
  const [city, setCity] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState(null);

  const onSearch = () => {
    fetch(
      `${API_BASE_URL}/data/2.5/forecast?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`
    )
      .then((response) => response.json())
      // update the results
      .then((results) => setResults(results));
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Row>
        <Col>
          <h1>Search your city</h1>
        </Col>
      </Row>

      <Row>
        <Col xs={4} className="text-center">
          <FormControl
            placeholder="Enter city"
            onChange={(event) => setCity(event.target.value)}
            value={city}
          />
        </Col>
      </Row>

      <Row>
        <Col>
          <Button onClick={onSearch}>Check Weather</Button>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </>
  );
};
```
Okay, that's it for this post. For the `useEffect Hook and custom hooks`, we will continue on with the second part of the tutorial. 

Thanks for your time. I hope you liked it ðŸ¤ž
